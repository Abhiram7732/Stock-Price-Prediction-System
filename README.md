<h1>📌Overview:</h1>

A Streamlit web application that leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to forecast future stock prices based on historical closing prices.
Built with Python, Keras, yFinance, and Matplotlib, this app provides interactive visualizations, model insights, and predictive analytics.

<h1>🎯 Objectives:</h1>

1. Provide an intuitive interface for exploring historical stock data and trends.
2. Enable interactive forecasting using LSTM neural networks trained on closing price sequences.
3. Visualize key insights such as moving averages, predicted vs. actual prices, and training loss curves.

<h1>🚀 Features:</h1>

1. Stock data fetching via yfinance
2. Moving averages (100-day & 200-day) for trend analysis
3. LSTM model training with configurable parameters
4. Predicted vs Actual price visualization
5. Training loss curve to monitor convergence

<h1>🛠️ Technologies Used:</h1>
